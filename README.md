StreetChariot, is a web platform that allows less technically savvy individuals and/or travelers to  learn about and access public/private transportation web-apps.

The platform gives users one place to find information about new and popular transportation web-apps.   User’s can learn more about these different travel web-apps, access their websites, learn how to create an account on these platforms and favorite any of the services to come back to in the future.  

By using React and rails, the site provides a seamless user experience.  The site was engineered to be as easy to navigate and understand as possible, especially because its purpose is to help users learn about more difficult web-applications.  

The site gives users a place to gain knowledge and look into the different transportation service apps, understand their features and view their websites.  The user can favorite transportation apps and then come back to them in their favorites page.  

The platform was designed to have an extremely user friendly, and a stress free interface.  Using TailWindCSS and DaisyUI the site was designed with the user in mind.

One of the challenges I faced during the creation of this application was - the mapping over the longer Service model attribute values.  It took many attempts to figure out why, though it was in the rails console, and fetching, it would not display on the screen.  After continual trouble shooting I was able to get it to display all of the seed data, including description, features and signup.   

Authorization and Authentication: The platform incorporates authorization and authentication features to ensure secure access. This feature helps to protect user data and ensure that only authorized users can access the platform.
